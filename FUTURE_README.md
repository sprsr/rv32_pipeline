<p align="center"> A simple 5 stage pipeline in conformance with RISC V Standards.  <br>
  A single core capable of handling every RV32I Instruction.  Minimal verification has been conducted thusfar, however the framework to run simulations and view waveforms are in place.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This project was started to gain experience in digital design and brush up on chip architecture while becoming equipped with RISC V ISA.  RTL is described in Verilog 2012 and EDA tools consist of Icarus Verilog & Yosys. I also found the open source risc v assembler python package provided by _ very useful when testing in my Test Bench.  
The RV32 Pipeline is architected as a single core standard 5 stage pipeline.  Only Fetch and Decode stages will stall in two cases:  Failed Branch Prediction and sequential data conflict when the first instruction must write from data memory.  

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
